## Scope

* Service APIs for “CapabilitiesAndRuntimeRestrictions” (see APIBacklog.md)

* The API provides the API consumer with the ability to:  
  * Discover Capabilities and Constraints
  * Stay updated on changes
  * Adapt your requests Automatically
* Describe, develop, document, and test the APIs
* Started: November 2024
